Hey James,
Thank you for sharing your script - I love how you naturally brought both your project and Milanote into the conversation.
One small feedback- Instead of mentioning you've been using for 'my exclusive videos', it would be great to discuss as your creative project / painting project.

Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s

Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! 
Many thanks,
Bella",approved,"OK guys while that’s drying. I will tell you about this videos sponsor which is Milanote:

Milanote is a tool for organising your creative projects. I’ve been using it for one of my exclusive videos which is a customers bespoke Tabernacle frame 

Milanote allows me to pull in reference images and create this mood board.

I can send this board to my customer by sharing it with them. I can email this board to my clients for feedback and keep them updated.

Another great thing that you can do is add videos into your board, this mood board has a video and this shows I’m going to ddd some distressing techniques, its great to have this on here rather than search for it everytime I need to reference it.

I can also have boards within boards so part of this design is going to  have a sgraffito technique, which is egg tempera and pigment. I’ve got another board that just highlights theses different sgraffito techniques.

You can also have  bullet point lists of what you should do or what you need to do next which is great for keeping your project on track.

It’s great to have everything in one place, I have found it really useful for this project. Milanote is available for free with no time limit so use the link in the description below and use Milanote for your next creative project. Massive thanks to Milanote for sponsoring this video. Now let’s get back to The Threadbare Signor...",4

Bella",approved,"-I’ve always wanted to design my own characters. I have so many ideas in my head, but I struggle with procrastination, and it’s hard to bring those ideas to life. That’s why I started using Milanote. It helps me organize my thoughts, track my progress, and actually take action on my creative projects. ( Show my past original character works  , & scattered references to contrast before using Milanote)

-Today, I’ll be sharing how I use Milanote for moodboarding and collecting references—specifically for designing my oc design. Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.
-I have some ideas about this oc. I usually start by collecting clothing references from pinterest. And we can noted out with some element we love under the reference, like this sweater and cutting. So it will be clear when we draw. 
-I think hair can reflect a character's personality very well ! I hope she looks naughty and a little lazy.  Milanote also has a draw function, so we can draw our idea beside.

-Another feature I love is the color swatch tool —I can easily mark down my character’s main colors using color swatch. The large color blocks help me focus and stay consistent with the palette.
-Since I want my character to have some magical abilities, I created a separate board for magic-related inspirations. This keeps my main board still clean ~ and we just need to click it when need.
-As a reference for this outcome, I collect some pictures of the effects I hope to achieve. It’s a great reference point to check back on anytime.
-And To-Do List !! As someone who struggles with procrastination, having a checklist helps me track my progress .
-Once I’ve gathered enough references and formed a clear image of my character in my mind, I know I’m ready to start sketching!
-I usually collect enough information to build a general impression of the character in my mind, which I think is enough to get started. Then, we can start sketching.
-If at any point during the process we feel things aren’t clear and unsure , we can always go back and find more reference.
--------------------------------------
Sketching my idea-(explained the idea) (Ticked To-Do List  )
Line-(some line tips) 
Coloring-(apply base color, find some color reference,
Finally touch up the character
~Done~ Show the Final Art

I am so happy this time can show my art process from idea, reference until the final outcome.

Hey Milljosoul,
So excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project.
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! 
Please see the creative brief for all campaign instructions.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete a project plan board and add a sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

And that’s where milanote comes in! Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects!

Milanote’s essentially a digital bulletin board that has many helpful features when it comes to the planning stages of products, theyre especially helpful for character creation! 

My main use for milanote was making character mood boards since currently death academia is MEGA heavy on the aesthetics and characters. It’s a super great place to store stuff that i think is just soooooo death aca core, you know? 

With easy tools such to do lists so you know exactly what you need to work on, and board nesting, being able to put boards within boards so you don’t have to spend a million years looking for every single board

Just drag n drop and boop! Right there board in a board 

It also lets you straight up draw on boards for when you have an idea that hits right then and there, as well as color palette creation, very helpful if you’re working with a specific color scheme in mind like i am! 

Oh whats that? Youre on a team and you’d like to collaborate! Milanotes got you covered there as well with their simple add editors feature! 

And no worries if you feel frustrated when you see blank spaces because milanotes got you covered in that department too! Theyve got hundreds of free to use templates for when you’re just too nervous to start

Many thanks,
Bella",approved,"So you might be thinking, ‘That’s great and all, but what does plan, reference and create even look like? How do I even start planning or gathering references?’ 

No worries, I’ll walk you through how you could start!

First, you’ll need somewhere to collect your ideas visually. This could be just another file or canvas, but if you want something more organized, I recommend trying out Milanote, the sponsor of today’s video! 

Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects. You can create visual boards with notes, images, colors, and more, nest boards within each other, sketch or draw directly on the board, and so much more! 

- Let’s start with **Planning.** I started by listing out possible background or illustration ideas on a text card, and bold the ones I like. After I pick out a few that I like, namely Lighthouse, Winter forest, Cabin, and Fishing boat, I make new boards by just clicking and dragging the board icon. These create nested boards within the main board we are currently on. A feature I really like is how it automatically picks out a relevant icon based on the name too, to make it visually recognizable!
- Within each of those boards, I want to elaborate a little bit more on the idea as I plan out what it could look like before I even start drawing. This is where I can start moving into finding references! Because of the title of this board, Milanote automatically suggests photos relevant to the title, in this case ‘lighthouses’, and I can add them quickly here, too. I drag some photos I like onto the board here which creates these cards, and for more photos, I look on Unsplash for a few more photo references. After that, I roughly sketch out some thumbnails, make some notes, and we’ve finished our first board!
- After that, I repeat basically the same thing for the winter forest board, once again finding some possible reference images, sketching some ideas, and then writing down some further notes.
- But for the cabins board, since there’s a few ideas I want to find references for, in Milanote, you can group objects by making a column and then dragging photos there to separate different ideas or thoughts. You can add anything here, like text, photos, colors, links, but for now I’m keeping it to just photos and text. After I split up the ideas, I draw thumbnails for each side, and finish this board, too!
- Finally, for the last idea, I collect references around a fishing boat, finding photos and sketching thumbnails. As I sketch thumbnails, I also have ideas for what colors I want to use primarily in the drawing, so I can add that by clicking these three dots, then clicking and dragging ‘Colors’ onto the board. Milanote automatically selects a color from the board for you, but you can adjust this yourself, color pick a different color from the board, or use a specific hex color. I go back and add a few colors for the other boards, and we’re done!
- If you’re following along, you don’t necessarily need to brainstorm this many ideas, but Milanote is a great tool for collecting references and all sorts of ideas all in one place. If you want to draw any background, the important thing is to **Find and collect a variety of references**.

Having all of this in one spot through Milanote makes it easy to go back and forth between planning and referencing without losing track of anything. It’s helpful to keep your references visually close to your canvas, whether by having it as another tab, on another screen, or even on the same canvas in the corner.

Hey Lexi,

So excited to be working with you on this project!

Thanks for sharing your idea—it sounds fantastic. We’d love for this integration to really resonate with the writers in your audience. Please find the creative brief attached with all the campaign details.

Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:

✨ Showcase Board Nesting – Highlight how Milanote allows for organised project planning by creating a main project plan board and adding sub-boards (e.g., a moodboard or storyboard).

📌 Demonstrate Project Planning Elements – Planning a creative project can feel overwhelming, so showcase how Milanote makes it easier. Consider adding:

A to-do list and budget table to help with scheduling and organisation.
Columns to structure the planning stages.
Comments to collaborate with colleagues or clients.
🎨 Incorporate a Variety of Elements – The most visually engaging boards include a mix of elements like color swatches, notes, product links, and drawings to bring a creative vision to life.

For inspiration, here’s a great example from Sketches of Shay: Watch here.
(And a quick note—please enable editor mode when sharing your board link.)

Looking forward to seeing what you create!

Thank you for sharing your script - I love how you naturally brought both your project and Milanote into the conversation.
Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.

+ 60 SECOND AD (rough script below, I'll include a combination of talking head A-ROLL and interactive screen recordings of Milanote's features)

To visualize our ideas for the camp elements and the tech elements of Cabin 5, Laurel and I used Milanote, a tool for organizing creative projects. I found it to be perfect for our moodboards, because we could add so much personal customization. We were able to use images, captions, and comments, and link everything together in a way that visually made sense to both of us. The collaboration feature was seamless, which is really important since we're working on this project together and need to keep track of so many different ideas in real time. You'll notice that the boards we mare are graphic-heavy, but Milanote can also be used for text-heavy projects as well. They even have templates built in for writers, such as character profiles and a handful of different story outlines. All you need to do is click a button and start filling in the details.

Milanote is a free creative organization tool built for creatives like me, who love organization tools, moodboards, and planners but don't love… the desk space they tend to occupy. Milanote lets me do everything from planning my complicated 3d rigs to curating a moodboard for graphic design, to collaborating on group projects with my friends.
I use Milanote because I am a compulsive reference gatherer, having a bunch of similar images in one place helps me brainstorm new ideas, and with features to link multiple boards together I can form this sort of spiderweb of knowledge where I can connect my reference to my rig plans to my project planning, to my birthday list.

No matter who you are, there's a Milanote use for every creative, filmmakers, graphic designers, writers, content creators, 2d artists who ARE going to make that awesome music video with all of their OCs right… you’re starting it TODAY right. I’m holding you to that!

When you’re ready to share your work, you can send it off to anyone you know to collaborate and expand your ideas, I sent this robot off to Artmanoil to add more robot ideas to it, we like robots a lot ok?

Hey Eni,
So excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project.
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! 
Please see the creative brief for all campaign instructions.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete a project plan board and add a sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

At least, for me it is. I find that a good way to compartmentalize all this information is by presenting them visually through something like a moodboard.

So for this segment, we’re doing it with today’s sponsor Milanote. It’s a great tool for organizing your creative projects, and it’s free.

I can save my references here really easily and reduce the clutter, instead of just having them opened as a web page or a document. You can also make it link back directly to your source, which is really handy when you want to see more of the artist’s body of work, and you don’t want to lose track of who to credit.

As artists, we tend to naturally be visual learners, so a tool like this is genuinely such a helpful thing to keep things organized in a way that makes sense to you.

Right here, I’ve listed down my observations of the rendering style’s characteristics. I can intuitively point out what parts of the artwork I’m referring to. You can write notes, draw on it, make checklists, attach videos, and so much more. You can even further organize your project into several different sub boards if you need to, all in one place.

If you’re working on a collaborative project, you can also easily share your boards with other people for them to leave feedback and work together on the board in real-time.

Again, Milanote is available for free with no time-limit so sign up for a Milanote account using the link in the description. Thank you to Milanote for sponsoring this video. Genuinely, great tool.",4

Hey Hana, 

Thank you for getting back with your script so quickly. It is absolutely fantastic as usual and I am happy to approve it!

Here are some screen-recording reminders to make sure no major edits are required to the video : 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 

Looking forward to seeing your draft video soon and thank you for all your great work so far!!

Himika",approved,"Introduce Milanote: So let me introduce you to Milanote, the sponsor of today’s video! I am a scatter-brained mess, and yet somehow I manage my way through the most complex of projects like making my own VTuber, or putting together lore and research videos. That is because I’ve been using Milanote, a powerful organization tool where you can plan, brainstorm, and collaborate on all your creative projects in a flexible workspace.
How it helps me, and how it can help the viewer: Yours boards are customizable to your liking, so you can add as many images, notes, and references as you need. For me, having a way to visually organize my thoughts in this unstructured manner helps my creativity flow. I love that I can mold my board to any topic I want.
Show how I use it for this project: For this ibisPaint video, I needed a way to organize all of my tips. So I have my main board here that acts as a homepage and reminder on my overall vibe and goals with the artwork, as well as sub-boards for my written tips and image references.
Show sub board 1: As we enter our first sub-board, you can see this is where I’ve written down all of my tips. Each tip corresponds to a different part of the drawing process like sketching, coloring, background, etc. So I’ve added arrows to show that flow. Between each tip, I’ve created a to-do list I can easily check off once I’ve finished each part. 
Feature 1: I actually made this board using the Beat Sheet template. You can easily access it by selecting More Templates on a new board and searching up Beat Sheet. 
Show sub board 2: My second sub-board is just a collection of my references I used for my studies. I included notes on my board both by typing them in the Note tab, as well as drawing them on directly to the board. I circled things in the references I particularly wanted to make note of like the shine concentrated in one line, and the draping of the skirt.
Feature 2: Milanote is also great for collaborating. You can invite your team to give you feedback in real time. My partner is showing me more places I can find references here. I have planned all of my projects from the last nine months using Milanote, and I really believe that it can help you jumpstart your projects this year.
CTA: And the best part is, Milanote is available for free with no time limit. So you can sign up using my link in the description!

Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete a project plan board and add a sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. (Please enable editor mode when sharing the board link)

Hey James,

So excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project. Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! Please check out the creative brief to see examples of how you can use Milanote for your restoration project. You can create painting research boards, create a moodboard for inspiration etc.

Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete a project plan board and add a sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s
(Please enable editor mode when sharing the board link)

———
On Screen: Shot of me talking to camera
———
- So how do you organize your sewing projects?
- I’ve recently been using this wickedly wonderful new tool, Milanote, the sponsor of this video.


[About Milanote]
———
On Screen: Dragging Images onto the canvas.
———
- Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.
- It’s an online canvas you and I can use to brainstorm and plan our sewing projects.


[How I use Milanote & what my audience would like about it too!]
———
On Screen: Dragging Images onto the canvas.
———
- I am currently looking to make myself a new coat.
- I started by gathering a whole bunch of inspiration images.
———
On Screen: Adding Arrows & organizing images.
———
- As I started organizing the images, I realized there were 3 key themes that I want to explore.
- List 3 themes.
———
On Screen: Clicking into the next board.
———
- Now that I have a good idea of what I’m making, it’s time to start planning this thing out.
———
On Screen: Shots of adding fabric samples
———
- I found the perfect fabrics.
- Yes, I’m making a black coat. Shocker.
- But, check out the lovely lining fabric I’m putting on the inside.
———
On Screen: Shots of adding colours samples
———
- But as someone who loves colour, you can easily drop in colour swatches to see how they look together
———
On Screen: Shots of adding links
———
- Best of all, I can add links right back to the fabrics, so when I’m ready to buy, I don’t need to find them again.
———
On Screen: Shot of adding tables to canvas and adding functions
———
- I can even add in a mini spreadsheet and cost out the entire project!
- I simply add the amount of yards I’ll need, cost per yard, do a simple sum function and boom!
———
On Screen: Shot of adding notes & images
———
- The last step is to plan out the specifics of the actual garment.
- What type of collar & pockets should I add?

This is great! Can't wait to see the draft video (:",approved,"A lot goes into setting up these 3D challenges before we launch them, so today Imma show you how I setup challenges from a project management standpoint using Milanote, the sponsor of today's stream. 

Milanote is a web-based tool for organizing your creative projects. So for our challenges, I have things split into pre-production, production, post production and review. 

In the pre-production board, I've organized a bunch of to-do lists, starting with the core tasks which will dictate the rest of our setup, like challenge sponsors, guests, FAQ's, the landing pages, all the way through marketing the challenge.

In the Production board, we're tracking stuff like the submission form and live stream tasks, And in the post production board, judging tasks come first, before moving into stuff like editing the montages, prepping for the judging stream and marketing those videos.

And of course you can share this project tracker with your team so everyone can work off of this, and know what's due and when, all in real-time.

Milanote has a bunch of templates you can start your project tracking from too. I used a storyboard, and mood-board template to see what me and Fabricio's title sequence would look like inside of Milanote. 

If you have a hard time tracking all your projects and ridiculous hobbies like me, then give Milanote a shot. It's free, with no time limit, so give it a shot by clicking the link in the description below.",4

Hey Dolly,
Thank you for sharing your script - I love how you naturally brought both your project and Milanote into the conversation.
Feel free to start drafting the video segment whenever you're ready. Here are our top tips for creating great screen recordings:
Tip 1: Seeing Milanote in action - When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
Tip 2: Get interactive with your boards - Show us how you build your boards on screen. Whether it's adding arrows, notes, or color swatches, walk us through your process for brainstorming ideas inside Milanote. (Here's a trick, hide some images into the unsorted column and drag it out into your board)
Tip 3: Let's see the full picture - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. Here is a great screen recording example from creators Tofugoob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s and Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFWF9BF9r_I&t=201s
For more helpful insights, be sure to check out the creative brief.
Looking forward to seeing the draft video soon! (And if you're sharing an unlisted video link, please include the CTA in the description box).
Many thanks, Bella",approved,"This challenge did require a lot of organization, and luckily I had today’s sponsor to help me out! 
Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects, and I have to say, it was a huge help for my creative process in this video. Whenever I have to gather references and write down important details for a project, they tend to get a little scattered, and I sometimes have a hard time finding my notes. With Milanote, I’m able to write down any specific details I need to keep in mind right alongside my references, which is extremely helpful when I’m trying to remember what interested me specifically in that photo. 
For this project, I separated each character into her own board, and added separate sections for reference photos from the show, and my inspiration photos for the new design I would be working on.

I was also able to communicate my observations very easily with the multitude of features that Milanote offers. For example, I noticed that flutterbat’s color pallet was slightly different from fluttershy’s, and I was able to create these color chips with the eye-dropped colors from both designs. This gave me a clear look at the subtle desaturation Flutterbat has, which would have been very hard to see without this neat little tool! I could add links to videos, make To-do list to keep my self on track, and even sketch directly on the board in case I needed to doodle something out really quickly, which i think is great for artist who might find it easier to communicate ideas with drawings like I do.

Milanote has a bunch of built in templates for a wide selection of different types of projects, giving you a really great jumping off point and helping to keep it visually appealing with barely any effort. It’s especially great for any collaborative creative projects you might be working on. You can just invite your team and get real-time feedback, making communication a breeze. 

Milanote is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project. It’s a really great tool for creatives, and I plan on using it for many projects in the future! Thank you again to Milanote, and let’s continue on with the designs!",4

Hey Cornelius,

Thanks for sharing these boards—they look fantastic! It's truly inspiring to see your creativity in action.

One thing that could be great to highlight is board nesting (boards within boards). I’ve added the moodboard into your main project so your audience can see you click into it and get a clear understanding of how board nesting works.

I'm really excited to start working on the boards, but I have a question for Milanote about the source of images and sketches.

Hey Dolly,
So excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project.
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! I'm happy to move forward with it.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s
Looking forward to seeing your boards come together! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link) Many thanks, Bella",approved,"The video topic I have planned is a “My Little Pony Character Redesign” video, in which I create designs of the characters with more villainous counterparts.

Thanks for explaining - happy to move forward with this concept.

Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
- Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
- Add variety of notes, not only images
- Add color swatches
- Add drawings
- Add comments for team collaboration 

For the script: Please ensure the following-
- Introduction: “Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects.”
- Describe how your audience could use Milanote i.e. “Milanote is perfect for creative professionals, teams, and creative hobbyists."" or “Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project.""
- Call to action: “Milanote is available for free with no time-limit so sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in the description.”",approved,"17 Feb2025:
That might be tough because we do all our drawings in the moment of recording. So all the boards we make would also be done in the moment of recording as well. If you wanted to you could provide us with a list of the features you want us to make sure we use during the recording and we can make sure we highlight all of those then we can send you the video and add anything you think we may have missed! 

I can make sure the team explores Milanote before the recording too so they’re familiar with the features prior to the recording session! 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Update:

Hey there, all the art crafted for the “pitch” would get made and constructed during the recording process so the pitches in of themselves would be the art project. 

Our content revolves around art games so framing it that way is gonna be very important to making sure that the video performs well 




---------------
Toonuki Lab has a game called ""Pitch Deck"" where we try to pitch to a CEO (the game master) on crazy ideas. We typically do them with slides but we could easily use Milanote to present our artwork for the video and use the tool throughout the game so it gets shown off the whole time outside of the 2 minute integration spot. 

The idea for this video would be ""Pitching the Next Pokemon Game"" 

There's about to be a bunch of pokemon news in the mix this year so it should be plenty topical and evergreen!",1

Hey Zorpazorp,
So excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project.
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! I'm happy to move forward with it.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

The script is absolutely perfect is great as usual and I am happy to approve it!

Just wanted to point out some small thing: the new CTA for this video would be https://milanote.com/monicarazak0125 as mentioned above. 

Other than that, I am happy for you to get started on your draft video.

Though you might already be familiar with these, here are some reminders for creating a great screen recording: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 

Remember to go back to the Creative Brief as well for further reference and inspiration. 

Looking forward to seeing your draft video soon and thank you for all your great work so far!!

Milanote script

To stay organized while taking on this seemingly impossible task of putting together a 52-day market booth from scratch, I immediately created a new Milanote board to visually map out literally everything I needed to make this market a success. Thank you to Milanote for sponsoring this portion of the video! Milanote is the ultimate tool for creatives like me to visually organize my ideas and projects. I use Milanote for organizing product launches, big events/markets like Bryant Park, or even in my personal life I used Milanote to fully map out my wedding plans. [show Milanote main board] This is the main board I created for the Bryant Park Winter Village market 2024 and it has EVERYTHING I needed on it to plan out the market before it started. But not only that, it also has all the stats and details of how the market panned out for me to reflect on - and that’s what we’re going to talk through in this video!

[show b-roll of all of the features I’m mentioning in this portion] Milanote has a number of click and drag features that I added to this board including text blocks, images, links to my youtube videos that are related to this market, to-do lists, I have a number of boards in here where detail out how each week of Bryant Park went so that the main board doesn’t get too cluttered. I love that this is essentially the second-brain mood board that I refer to whenever I’m trying to refocus my creativity, or just to have a pretty place to reference all the details of this project. One of my favorite features of this Milanote board is that everything kinda snaps into space [show demonstration], which makes the board feel more clean and organized without me putting too much effort into it. I also love this table item that I dragged onto my board that helps me keep track of my expenses while working on this project. Oh and I also realized that on my iPad, I can draw on the Milanote board whenever I feel like adding in my own personal doodles or hand-written notes.

[show Milanote templates and my nested boards] I also didn’t create this board from scratch or any of these nested boards - they’re all made from pre-made Milanote templates which makes Milanote the simplest tool to use as a business owner, student, artist, etc!

Himika",approved,"Exploring the complicated muscles of the male specimen and conveying these curves and contours into drawings on a plain white digital canvas is a rather enjoyable past time hobby I deem to find enjoyable way beyond my bedtime hours. But organizing all these photos of different muscles from various body parts, and carefully arranging them along side other artists that express the same afflictions as myself with drawings all in one cute its bits folder for otherwise normal consumption was always a game of chess with my computer until I found a better platform that provides all these and much more with today’s sponsor, milanote. For those of you who don’t know, Milanote is an interactive tool that helps you organise and visualise the planning stages of your creative projects on one platform so accessing them can be easier. Milanote allows you to collect and organize pictures, videos, notes and text, and arrange them into different boards using any of their built in templates that make it easy to start off your creative projects. You can also create several tasks for different things you want to study, and tick them when you’re done. Using milanote is quite easy, I start by creating a general board where I’ll layout a broad overview for everything concerning the project I’m about to work on, then I’ll move on to place my references in a sub board and place all the artists i’m drawing inspiration from in a separate board so I know where to find each of them and also place them side by side so I can compare and learn all at the same time. I like to use milanote’s web clipper tool to pull images from the world wide web, and then save every image or screenshot I find useful In its respective board. 
 Milanote also works well when you’re collaborating with other artists and working on the same project, so everyone has a good understanding of what the project is about and has access to the same references all at once since everything is properly organized in the same place.
The kind folks at milanote are giving free access with no time limit to everyone who signs up for a free account using the link in the description.

Let's have a look at the design inspiration for this project and my long to-do list. I'll also share how I stay organised while managing multiple projects at once.

Milanote intro 
For this project, I'm using Milanote. Milanote is such a handy tool for organising creative work. It lets me keep everything in one place, from notes and to-do lists to images, links, and files. I can save inspiration from the web and move things around on the board however I like.

It's great for getting a clear visual overview of a project, and if you're working with a team, you can collaborate in real time, too. It's really intuitive, very user-friendly, and easy to jump in and start organising. 

I find it super helpful in keeping all my ideas and tasks in check, especially when I've got multiple projects on the go.

Let me show you my board for the hallway. I've added inspiration and product images, saved links, and made a list of everything I need to order.
I've also got my drawing with the stair measurements, and it's all in one place and super easy to find. No more cluttered pages all over my desk! I love how everything for my project stays organised in one spot.

*Talk through the design elements of the projects, chat about how you can use Milanote as a mood board initially, and then you can layer on to the board with to-do lists, comments, etc. 


Call to action 

Starting a new project can feel overwhelming, but Milanote makes it easy with over 100 built-in templates for all kinds of creative projects.  

It's perfect for creative projects; whether you're a filmmaker, interior designer, writer, or content creator, Milanote is designed to help you stay organised and keep everything in one place.  

And the best part? It's free to use with no time limit! You can sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in the description.

**Part two of the script, share before sharing the progress of the project.**

Let's revisit the project and see what tasks I can tick off my to-do list and if there is anything new, I can add to my project board. 

I will go through the progress and then share my other Milanote boards. ( I have an audience that loves gardening, so I want to share my garden boards to give them ideas on how they can use Milanote for their non-home projects) 

Add call to action


Don't forget that Milanote is free to use and has no time limit! 
You can sign up now for a free Milanote account using the link in the description, and I will pin the link in the comments section as well. Let me know if you use it to create a board for your next project.",4

We typically do them with slides but we could easily use Milanote to present our artwork for the video and use the tool throughout the game so it gets shown off the whole time outside of the 2 minute integration spot. 

The idea for this video would be ""Pitching the Next Pokemon Game"" 

There's about to be a bunch of pokemon news in the mix this year so it should be plenty topical and evergreen!",1

Hey Magoonka,
So excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project.
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! I'm happy to move forward with it.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s
Looking forward to seeing your boards come together! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link) Many thanks, Bella",approved,"Video topic:  follow up about my original characters, I was going to be using Milanote to jot down and plan out ideas for the characters and story",1

This room is a fun, albeit tiny one with a window overlooking the lake. We’re really excited to transform it!

Hey Toonuki Lab,

I’m really excited to be collaborating with you on this upcoming project!

Thanks so much for sharing your idea with us. For the first collaboration, we were hoping to focus more on demonstrating how Milanote can be used to organise an art project, rather than showcasing a pitch idea. We think this could be a great fit for the initial integration, and the pitch idea could work well for a second one.

Let me know what you think! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Hey Nancy, 

Really excited to have you on board for this! While your video idea sounds really good, I think a video like your Makeover (bedroom makeover/bathroom makeover etc.) might be a better fit for a Milanote integration, based on our analysis of our previous DIY video integrations. 

Let me know you have any more such videos planned that you think might a good fit :) Thank you!

I think it will be perfectly timed for the arrival of Spring with lots of fresh green garden-themed imagery.",1

The way that I'd like to integrate Milanote into this is showing how I moodboard my spring projects and the vibe that I would like to curate (colors, styles, designs, etc.) I would love to encourage my audience to try out milanote for modboarding their spring projects and show how it can help foster creativity and organize ideas all in one place. I would like to include this integration after the introduction to the video and screen record the setup of my moodboard to show the audience how easy it is to get started as well as show them different features that would be helpful in this process.",1

Hey Karen, 

No worries! Thanks for the update on this and for including the edits. This looks great! 

Here are reminders on screen-recording for the draft video to make sure no major edits are required: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Thank you!

Best, 
Himika",approved,"Hello Himika, I’m so sorry for the late response. 
I ran into some issues while working on the painting, which then caused delays. I still need some more time to complete the painting, finish filming and then move onto editing the video. 
I’ve also changed the script and mentioned the built-in template feature too, lmk if there’s any other issues. Once again, I’m terribly sorry for the delay, I will try to get the video done asap! 


""Starting a painting from scratch is the hardest part for me because there are so many elements to consider—composition, colour palette, materials, references, and more. To make this process smoother, I’m using Milanote, which also happens to be the sponsor of today’s video.

Milanote is an excellent tool for organising your creative projects. Think of it as a visual planning workspace where you can create mood boards, checklists, and organise your notes, references, and ideas—all in one place.

Right now, I’m using Milanote to create a mood board for this painting. I started by searching for reference photos online, which I can simply drag and drop onto my mood board. I like to spread the photos out like this and rearrange them to see how well they work together. I also use the colour picker tool to create a few palettes that I think will suit my painting. This is especially helpful for anyone who struggles with building cohesive colour palettes for their artwork.


At the same time, I’ve created a task card to list the materials I need to buy and outline the steps for creating the painting. Since I’ll be using multiple mediums, planning out the steps for each stage helps me stay organised and have a clear picture of what to do next.

*********edited part**********

If you often struggle with planning your creative projects or need a versatile tool to bring all your ideas, notes, and inspiration together, Milanote has you covered. If you are not sure where to begin, Milanote also offers a library of over 100 built-in templates, giving you a head start on all kinds of creative projects. 

If Milanote sounds like the perfect fit for you, now it’s a great time to try it out as it is free to use with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project. """,4

Hey Sunny,
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! I'm excited to start this upcoming collab.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s

Hey Oyun Orka,
Thanks so much for sharing your project idea - this sounds fantastic! I'm excited to get this collaboration started.
Before you start drafting your boards, it would be great if you could check out our previous collaboration videos and the board examples inside the creative brief.
Here are some tips for creating great-looking boards:
Tip 1: Showcase board nesting (boards within boards) - Aim to complete at least one main project board and one sub-board (i.e. moodboard, storyboard).
Tip 2: Show project planning elements - Planning a creative project can feel daunting, so demonstrate ways to make it easier with the use of Milanote's features. For instance, you could add a to-do list and budget table to assist with scheduling and organization. You could add columns to structure the planning stages of the project, as well as add comments within the board to collaborate on ideas with colleagues or clients.
Tip 3: Add a variety of elements - The best-looking boards are ones that include a variety of elements i.e. color swatches, notes, product links and drawings to inspire and guide the design vision. Here is an example of a great looking board - Sketchesofshay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSerPv9nlcw&t=372s
Looking forward to seeing your boards come together! (please enable editor mode when sharing the board link) Thanks, Bella",approved,"For the use case, I'd love to showcase some of Milanote's features through planning out an illustration background by collecting references, creating cards for different ideas, drawing rough sketches in Milanote, and talking through my process before moving into my drawing program.",1

Hey, 

Really amazing work on the script!! I am really impressed and happy to approve it :) Feel free to get started on your draft video. 

Here are some screen recording reminders to make sure no major edits are required to the draft video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. 
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I look forward to reviewing the draft video soon :) 

Best, 
Himika",approved,"I’m really excited to be finally at the stage of putting the finishing touches on this bathroom, and I’m excited to show you guys the finished result… but I can start by sharing our inspiration for where we want to take this bathroom design. 

We’ve been using Milanote for the last year to help design this house, and they happen to be today’s video sponsor. 

Milanote is the prefect tool for organizing all of your creative projects. You can think of Milanote as a digital canvas to gather all of your ideas and to visually create a mood board for where you want to take your project. They have over 100 built in templates available for every type of creative project. 

So here is our milanote inspirational board for the bathroom, and what I love about milanote is how easy it is to drag in images, circle what you like about the design, add in notes and todo list, and just have one central place to store all of your ideas.

I primarily use Milanote to gather inspiration that I pull from around the internet, I can highlight certain design elements, pair them next to another inspirational picture that I found, and start to compile a visual reference for what I want the house to eventually look like. 

A great feature of milanote is the clipper feature, so as your browsing the internet if you find a product or a picture you like as an inspiration, you can clip that to one of your boards without every leaving the website, so it will be there when you come back to milanote.

You also can create sub boards that can be placed within each board, which really helps to organize your project. 

Milanote is also prefect for working with teams, or in our case, a spouse… as you can easily gather feedback and collaborate in real time. 


And the best part is Milanote is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description. You can also scan the QR code on screen. And let me know what creative project you are working on! But with that, let's get back to it.",4

Hey Maddie, 

The video idea sounds great, however, I feel like a Milanote integration in a DIY video (e.g. your ""Dream Living Room Transformation from Start to Finish"" video) would be more relevant. Let me know if you have any such upcoming videos :) 

Thank you so much!

Best,

I’d have multiple boards to show how I organize for both YouTube and some of my more personal projects and I’d walk the viewers through the processes, adding notes and photos as needed. 

I’d include all the talking points but also try to focus on integrating the audience into the process itself to get them excited about exploring their own potential projects through Milanote. The video example  I resonated most strongly with is “I Read more Harry Styles Book Recommendations and I’m Worried, Darling”, so there would likely be some format similarities, though mine would be unique to my own projects and of course be a longer integration.

Hey Monica, 

The boards look amazingg!! I am really happy with the amount of detail you have gone into. 

Just one small suggestion- it would be great if you could build out the moodboard as well and show it to the audience because right now the boards are leaning more towards general organisation than visual planning, so it would be great to have a moodboard to balance that. Hope that makes sense :)

Hey Karen, 

The script looks great and brings out Milanote's value really well. Just one small addition that I wanted to mention: can you please also briefly talk about the built- in templates (maybe something along the lines ""and if you are not sure where to begin, Milanote offers over a 100 built-in templates to help you get started on a variety of different creative projects""). 

Other than that, happy for you to get started on your draft video. Here are some screen recording tips to make sure no major edits are required to the draft video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I look forward to reviewing the draft video soon :)

Himika ",approved,"Starting a painting from scratch is the hardest part for me because there are so many elements to consider—composition, colour palette, materials, references, and more. To make this process smoother, I’m using Milanote, which also happens to be the sponsor of today’s video.

Milanote is an excellent tool for organising your creative projects. Think of it as a visual planning workspace where you can create mood boards, checklists, and organise your notes, references, and ideas—all in one place.

Right now, I’m using Milanote to create a mood board for this painting. I started by searching for reference photos online, which I can simply drag and drop onto my mood board. I like to spread the photos out like this and rearrange them to see how well they work together. I also use the colour picker tool to create a few palettes that I think will suit my painting. This is especially helpful for anyone who struggles with building cohesive colour palettes for their artwork.


At the same time, I’ve created a task card to list the materials I need to buy and outline the steps for creating the painting. Since I’ll be using multiple mediums, planning out the steps for each stage helps me stay organised and have a clear picture of what to do next.

If you often struggle with planning your creative projects or need a versatile tool to bring all your ideas, notes, and inspiration together, Milanote is perfect for you and it is available for free with no time limit. Sign up using the link in the description and start your next creative project.",4

It's a giant digital whiteboard that's super useful for mapping out your ideas, and this type of tool can be a huge help for something like prototyping a video game!  You can link websites, dump reference photos, create sticky notes, make connections between everything, and draw on top of all of it in this really organic way that anyone can use.  I really appreciate how it's truly a blank canvas and can fit just about any needs.  

Like here I organized some important notes on prototyping that kept me focused on what's important for my new project.  I wrote goals and inspirational quotes and I genuinely believe it's impossible to make a Milanote board look ugly- everything is always so effortlessly clean.

It can also be a moodboard that collects vibes and gives inspiration for whatever you're making.  

I love having fancier features like this kanban board that genuinely helped me prioritize my tasks for game development.

Milanote has tons of built-in templates for these sorts of things too, so you can see for yourself all the different things it can do for you.

The coolest thing is all of these boards can be contained within other boards so it all just links together in this super satisfying way that you just can't get without a tool like Milanote.  And all of this can be shared with a team and collaborated on in real-time.

So whether you're a game developer, filmmaker, interior designer, writer, or anyone just trying to get a little more organized, Milanote is a great companion for you.

Himika",approved,"I like to make my photography plan using Milanote, who were kind enough to sponsor today’s video. It’s an awesome tool for planning and organizing everything creative, let me show you.

I use Milanote all the time for planning like this, not just for concert photography, but for filmmaking, portrait shoots, moodboarding, you name it. 

I love that it’s just a giant blank canvas that I can throw infinity ideas at, which works so well for my brain. It’s also super easy to collaborate and work together with other people, so if I need to send a moodboard to a client or a shotlist to get it approved, it’s super seamless and easy. 

You can see here how I’ve made a mockup of how I plan to shoot a concert, with a checklist for essential shots, some research and reference material, and a mood board for the general vibe I’m going for.

There are hundreds of built in templates that cover everything from like, photography, all the way to web design, podcasting, and even architecture.

Himika ",approved,"The best tool I have found for keeping my ideas all in one space is Milanote who also happens to be today's video sponsor. 
Milanote is a tool for organising your thoughts and ideas in one place. It's like a digital canvas where you can plan, brainstorm and create mood boards for your concepts and ideas. 
To be honest, I get a little impatient creating mood boards when I have to physically cut out each little image as well as my printer always deciding not to work any time I go to use it to print anything. 
I also love that I can have it anywhere any time in the studio depending on where I am up to on a project. 


For the platter series I wanted to make sure that each platter was unique and had its own ideas. In a way my style is always going to cross over from each piece but I wanted each one to have its own inspirations and even trialling some experimental techniques. I found Milanote very helpful for this because I was able to upload photos of each platter onto each board and then play around with concepts and inspirations behind each one. 


I could also add little notes to remind myself what steps I wanted to take for each plate so I don't forget along the way with the process what techniques I am using on each plate and also where the inspiration has come from. 


From personal experience, I have found when I am embarking on a huge project like the 12 platters that I sometimes have a bit of decision and art paralysis. Its this feeling that I have so many ideas, so much inspiration and no idea how to sort my brain and commit to an idea. 


By having separate boards on Milanote I am able to consolidate all the inspiration and ideas in one place, erasing my feelings of decision paralysis when I am up to starting my next artwork. 
Beyond mood boards, I also used milanote to create my 2025 vision board, write down content ideas and concepts, plan holidays and so much more. The free version allows you to post 100 items whether they be notes, pictures or drawings. I found this super helpful to give it a good trial with low commitment to see how it integrated into my planning and I can say I have really loved it.

Hey Sarah,
 
I am really happy with the script and happy for you to proceed further. One minor edit: at the end can you please add ""but if you haven't yet check out the link in my description and sign up for a FREE account with no time limit"". 

Here are some screen recording tips to make sure no major edits are required to the draft video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about). 
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements. - Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements. 
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc. 

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I look forward to reviewing the draft video soon :) Best, Himika",approved,"I have something to admit to you, I had another cosplay planned for HolMat this year,
and I didn't finish it. Heroes of cosplay got caught in an extra week of content ID hell, so
It wasn't really due to poor planning, I actually planned it very well with Milanote, the
sponsor of this video. Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects,
And it remains my favorite way to plan out not just making a cosplay, cause I'm also
planning my wedding with it, I won't show you that massive board, but I will show you
the time lapse from my patreon stream where I planned my never complete St Trina
cosplay with my patrons.
Milanote also has tons of templates you can choose from to help you get started
organizing all your essentials, but I always start blank because it lets me just be
chaotic.
But for larger projects like group cosplays or for me, my wedding board, I like to keep
things in sub boards and organize them by columns, so its easier to keep track of where
everything is
With Milanote its so easy to keep all your reference photos easily accessible, You can
add to do lists, and for this cosplay i was trying to plan it on a very tight timeline, so I
also had a note in there where I tried to calculate how long it would take me to do
things,
The spreadsheets also mean you can keep your budget all right there,
And as someone who usually orders fabric, I like to keep all my links in one column, but
then once you've actually bought them you can collapse the column to get them out of
the way.
But if you like to shop for materials in person, the Milanote app makes it easy to keep all
the info you need right in your pocket. PLUS you can save your boards to PDFs and
print them out, so you can even use Milanote as a reference sheet maker, Or even a
build book creator for competitions. And the best part is its totally free to sign up, there's
no time limit to it being free
I really do make a Milanote board for every cosplay I make now, Im literally using it to
plan my wedding, and I know so many of you have already tried it and fell in love, but if
you haven't yet check out the link in my description, cause I think you'll love it as much
as I do.",4

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I look forward to reviewing the draft video soon :) Best, Himika",approved,"When I first started free handing my knit projects, I did so without any prep and just went straight in. I mostly ended up with projects that didn’t fit or I lost motivation because I didn’t have a clear idea in mind. Instead, I really recommend taking the time to plan out your project and think about what your end result should look like. I love using Milanote for this so let me show you how I plan out my freehand projects. 

I’m very happy to announce that Milanote is also the sponsor of this video. Milanote is a tool for organizing your creative projects, to help you plan, brainstorm, and collaborate on ideas.

First up I make sure I have all my materials ready, I love that I can tick them off as I gather them so I know what’s still missing. I then go straight into vision boarding and for this I made a separate board for just inspiration

Here I laid out my inspo from pinterest, instagram, screenshots and my phone and try to organise them into sections of what I like about them. Writing down what I do and don’t like really helps me then collate exactly what I want my project to look like

I add another column to my board and within that I create a table so i can make note of my gauge as well as my own body measurements. I used to always skip this part, but this is the most important step if you want to successfully freehand a jumper. Below the table I also like to add the yarn I am using to remind myself of the colour palette and also refer back to any product information.
 
The last thing I add is a step-by-step tracker to which breaks your knit project up into easy to follow steps, we’ll refer back to this throughout this video

Milanote makes starting a new project easy, with over 100 built-in templates available for every type of creative project. For example, I like to use the Craft Project Moodboard template to visualise project ideas that I have which helps me later on to actually bring them to live

Milanote is perfect for creative professionals - whether you’re a filmmaker, interior designer, writer, or content creator, it is designed to help you organise your work

Hey Shelby, 

Excited to be working with you on this collaboration!! Really love both the ideas but I feel like it would be really interesting to see Milanote in video option 1: Starting the New Year as a Pottery Business. 

Just one small thing I want to emphasise here - it would be great to majorly focus on the creative organisation side of the small business during the Milanote integration (e.g collecting design references, moodboarding, brainstorming concepts etc.) in addition to some logistical organisation (e.g. to-do lists, notes etc.) 

I would highly encourage you to go through your tailored Creative Brief to better understand each step of the collaboration.

Looking forward to seeing your boards soon and till then wishing you a very happy holiday season :) 


Best,

""1. Vlog format: Starting the New Year as a Pottery Business
This video will be a vlog of getting back into the swing of things in the new year, what's coming in 2025, planning and developing that goes behind the scenes of a business to start the year with success. This one is going to have some announcements in it as well bout my international travel plans. The Milanote will be integrated at the team meeting phase. This will show how we use Milanote to organise and brainstorm different concepts and ideas to keep the ideas all in one place. Showing the perk of Milanote being online and anyone can access it at any time!

2. Pottery Creation video; Mystery Plates (TBC timeline)
I am creating a series of mystery plates from my mystery moulds (see my Mystery Mug mould series on YouTube). This series will be creating a unique design to suit each plate. For this I will need to use vision boards and create sketches to get an idea of what each plate will look like. I could use the Milanote to bring these concepts together, using references and ideas to consolidate a vision board for a plate I am creating. 

Sorry to also be a bit vague on timeframes, I am still finalising my USA trips and content plans so I am not sure where everything will slot in yet! Option 2 will still apply to any creation video where I brainstorm inspirations and concepts to life even if it has to pivot slightly!""",1

The next steps would be to go through your tailored Creative Brief: https://www.notion.so/milanote/averpaula-Creative-Brief-160aaa0eb01380648723febb506c75ac and start drafting your Milanote boards for review (please make sure that editor mode is enabled when you share a link to your boards). 

Looking forward to reviewing your boards and till then wishing you a very happy holiday season :)

Best, 
Himika",approved,I’d love to go ahead with the 2-min mid roll integration. This would fit in quite nicely with a video concept I have planned where I will share how I design my own knit jumpers and cardigans. I could show Milanote as an essential tool to organise and visualise ideas for a new knit project.,1

Hey Monica, 

Great work with the reel - it looks fantastic! Just one thing to point out, could you please add a CTA at the end saying something along the lines ""and you wanna try Milanote for free for one of your own creative projects, you can sign up using the link in my bio"". 

Also, a note - we would be going on a blackout period (15 Dec - 11 Jan) during which we will not be going live with any sponsored content because of the holiday season. Let me know if you were able to go live by then :)

Thank you so much!

Hey Nathan, 

Thank you so much for your patience here - the video looks great and I love how naturally you have integrated Milanote by connecting it to your own work!!

I am happy to approve it and for you to go live with it whenever you are ready. Just one very minor edit: when you first introduce Milanote could you please display the full-screen animated logo on the screen (you should be able to find it under ""Step 3"" in the Creative Brief)

Hey pateseich, 

Really appreciate your flexibility here - thank you so much! The script looks fantastic and I am happy to approve it. 

Just one small addition: 
- could you please also briefly talk about the built-in templates (e.g. ""and if you are unsure about where to begin, Milanote offers over a 100 built-in templates for a variety of creative work"")

Other than that, feel free to put together your draft video. Even though you might already be familiar with these, here are some screen-recording tips: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief. 
- When introducing Milanote at the beginning of the segment, jump right into displaying Milanote boards on screen (We recommend showing your project board since that's what folks are most excited about).
- Get interactive with the great boards you have built. Delete some content from your boards and add it back in while screen recording so that your audience can see the process of how a board is built on Milanote instead of just pointing to the board elements.
- Screen record your boards in both full-screen view and zoomed-in view. This way, we can take in your entire masterpiece while also zooming in for a closer look at specific elements.
- Show all the different features in action! For example, when you talk about the built-in templates click into the templates in your screen recording; when you talk about the web clipper tool show yourself using the tool and adding an image on your board etc.

Also, a note - we will be going on a blackout period from 11 Dec - 11 Jan during which we won't be going live with any sponsored content for the holidays. Please let me know if you would be able to go live before then, if not we can work out a time in January :)

[chapter 1: showing some finished drawing]
- hey everyone! today, I'm finally sharing how I create portraits in my style. For this video, I'll be drawing Mingyu from Seventeen, he's been one of the most requested from you guys, and honestly, he's one of my favorites too.
- by the way, if you guys are curious about how I come up with ideas or how I pick references, some of you already know it---I've been using Milanote a lot to organize my art projects. I shared a link with you guys a while back, and I hope you've found it helpful! It's been such a great tool for me.

[showing how I use milanote]

If you're not familiar with Milanote, it's this visual tool designed for organizing ideas, projects, and inspiration. I use it mainly for gathering art references and creating vision boards, it's really versatile and fun to use!

Here's the board I shared with you guys. Feel free to explore it, I've added the link in the description below.
And here are some examples of my previous boards for sketchbook projects.
So basically, I drag photos around until I find a layout that works well together. this way I can avoid too much erasing when I transfer the ideas into my sketchbook. It really helps streamline the process. 

If you love organizing your workflow, making digital vision boards, or just want to keep your creative process smoother, you should definitely try Milanote. It’s free to start and has no time limits! You can find the link in the video description below. And if you try it out, let me know your thoughts in the comments!

Hey Phoebe, 

Really amazing work on the script!! I am really impressed and happy to approve it :) 

Feel free to get started on your draft video. Here are some screen recording tips to make sure no major edits are required to the draft video: 
- Remember to show our animated logo on the screen right as you introduce Milanote. You can find this in the Creative brief.

Thanks for the fantastic work so far and I look forward to reviewing the draft video soon :) 


Best, 
Himika",approved,"To plan this project, I have been using Milanote, a tool for organising and planning creative projects. Using MIlanote for my jinx doll has been such an asset in the creative process as its designed to act as a visual mood board. Allowing me to catalogue my web links, reference images, colour swatches, notes and much more. 

On the front page of my jinx board, I’ve included the Arcane 3D model sculpted by Tebalt Grannet, along with quick links to his portfolio on ArtStation which has the original model along with various renderings. With everything linked on the board, I can access his high-res work instantly without keeping tabs open all day—a huge convenience!

Milanote lets you organize your ideas the way you think. I'm quite a visual thinker, I tended to save reference images to a photodump, writing illegibly in notebooks and sticking papers to the wall. so being able to Drag and drop, cluster or stack elements brings clarity to an otherwise chaotic workflow.

One of the internal boards I created was the Design board, that ill use for sculpting and painting. I’ve layered the reference images for Jinx’s animation rigs, alongside my guideline sketches that I use when sculpting. 

Also on this board is everything I need for the painting stage—I have the preferred reference images, paired with my itemised list of paints, my painting guide, as well as fleeting notes that I want to remember. I'm also able to sketch directly onto the board for visual reminders like this [show], and add elements like colour swatches which you can sample directly from the board.


With such a variety of elements to use, I'm able to have that structure as well as flexibility, which is essential when organising a creative project.

Something i liked was the variety of temples to choose from, You can browse through and find the perfect fit for your project.
While the visual mood board approach works for the painting and sculpting aspect, I was able to use their craft project timeline template to create an itemised to do list and timeline.

This keeps my notes neat, while still providing that very visual way of organising. 

Milanote’s real-time collaboration feature also allows you to share boards with collaborators. So you can brainstorm together which is such valuable asset when working on creative projects.

If you would like to try milanote of yourself, you can sign up with my link in the description below, Milanote is available for free with no time limit, perfect for creating you own unique creative hub.",4
